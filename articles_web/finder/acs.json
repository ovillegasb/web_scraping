Furthermore, the interdependency between the combustion parameters and/or performance parameters was evaluated. The results reveals that, during the low-temperature reaction (LTR) region, the coefficient of variations (COV) of the ignition timing, initial temperature, and crank angle corresponding to the peak value of the heat release rate (HRR) are less than 3%. The cycle-by-cycle variations of the second stage combustion are strongly affected by the fuel equivalence ratio, and COVs improved substantially with the increase of the fuel concentrations. Meanwhile, both of the peak values of the HRR during the LTR and high-temperature reaction (HTR) show obviously cycle-to-cycle variations, and COVs increase with the fuel supply rate. Regarding the cycle-by-cycle variations of the performance parameters, COVs of the maximum in-cylinder pressure and pressure rise rate are very small except for the knock combustion. On the contrary, cycle-to-cycle variations of indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) and indicated thermal efficiency are very small except for the partial combustion, and variations improve with the increase of the fuel supply rate.

Most oilfield emulsions are never completely resolved before being sent downstream for refining. For example, Karl Fisher measurements always show some water present in the oil phase. Investigations were performed to probe select features of unresolved emulsions. Using the American Society for Testing and Materials D4807-88 procedure, which involves diluting samples with hot toluene, emulsion solids were isolated and then studied using scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectrometry.

Values of ε were nominally lower for asphaltene/resin model oil systems than asphaltene model oil systems, qualitatively similar to CEF trends. These observed phenomena are similar to the “Vroman effect”, observed in competitive protein adsorption. One plausible explanation is that resin-solvated asphaltenic aggregates are able to diffuse and adsorb to the interface more quickly than larger pure asphaltenic aggregates, but then a molecular rearrangement occurs in which resins become the primary adsorbent in the monolayer by reptation through the consolidated asphaltene network, displacing the asphaltenes and reducing the stability and the dilatational elasticity.

The addition of 0.1 wt % of poly(ethylene butene) (PEB), which has been shown to reduce the yield stress of the gelled solution 10-fold, actually increased the initial deposition rate.

In all experiments, the deposit was formed rapidly such that a thermal steady state was attained within 20−30 min. The deposit mass decreased with an increase in the Reynolds number, the wax−solvent mixture temperature, and the coolant temperature. The data were analyzed with a steady-state heat-transfer model, which confirmed the deposit mass to depend upon the relative magnitudes of the thermal resistances in series as well as the fractional temperature drop across the deposit layer. The estimated liquid−deposit interface temperature was shown to be close to the wax appearance temperature of each wax−solvent mixture. The average thermal conductivity of the deposit was estimated to be 0.35 W m", " K", ". The gas chromatograph analysis of deposit samples showed their wax content and carbon-number distribution to vary with the deposition time and Reynolds number.

Up to now, the focus in wax studies has been mainly on the radial transport of waxes to the cold wall through molecular diffusion, but other mechanisms that have been cited (and so far neglected) may count on the kinetics of deposit formation. An analysis of the experimental evidence is presented here, leading to the conclusion that an important role may be played by the axial convective transport and the oil gelation on the cold surface (i.e., by the bulk liquid-to-gel change driven by the temperature change). Gelation is faster than molecular diffusion and may lead to the formation of a loose solid network that is slowly filled by diffusion (by aging) in a successive step. An experimental apparatus has been employed to measure the gelation kinetics both on a model mixture and on a stock tank oil. Obtained data have been modeled by employing a classic solution of the conductive heat transfer problem. The qualitative agreement obtained indicates that the physics involved in gelation have been well identified. "]},

Despite the fact that asphaltenes obtained by the usual procedure are amorphous solids, numerous arguments support the second hypothesis. In this work, we present studies of asphaltene flocculation kinetics and compare the results with the kinetics of coalescence of flocculated asphaltenes that have been redispersed mechanically in the solvent. Redispersion of flocculated asphaltenes was realized using an ultrasound bath. Kinetic measurements were performed using a dynamic light scattering technique. The Malvern 4800 apparatus used in this study makes it possible for us to observe the growth of aggregates in the range of 2−5000 nm. It was found that kinetic curves for redispersed asphaltenes are very similar to those of the initial flocculation induced by an antisolvent. This finding confirms the liquid-like behavior of flocculated asphaltenes. Moreover, the energy of cohesion of asphaltene aggregates is very low, and consequently, the amount of energy needed for redispersion is also low. The aging of the flocculated sample accelerates the aggregation kinetics, which points to very slow reorganization of the asphaltene structure, leading to more compact, solid-like flocs. "]},

The model is based primarily on the moving boundary problem approach involving heat transfer with a phase change. A novel formulation based on the one-dimensional deformation of a cubical cage is proposed for incorporating the effect of shear stress on the deposition process. It is postulated that the application of shear stress causes tilting of the cubical cage, which leads to the release of a portion of the liquid phase. The tilted-cage deformation angle is estimated by matching the deposit-layer composition data from two recent experimental studies. A change in the deformation angle is predicted to result in a shift in the carbon-number distribution of the deposit. The shear stress is predicted to cause a wax enrichment of the deposit layer without affecting the deposit-layer thickness, which is governed mainly by heat-transfer and phase equilibrium considerations. The estimated deformation angle is shown to depend upon the fractional deposit thermal resistance (or the fractional temperature drop), deposit mass, and Reynolds number. The results of this study confirm that the deposition process is primarily thermally driven, while the deposit composition is influenced by shear stress and thermodynamic considerations. "]},

The model uses the Hildebrand solubility parameter of stock tank oil to predict the solubility parameter of the live oil under reservoir conditions by incorporating the dissolved gas composition along with the pressure−volume−temperature (PVT) properties of the live oil. Precipitation and deposition of asphaltenes from crude oils resulting from changes in pressure, temperature, and composition have a huge economic impact on the oil industry. Due to the uncertainty in mitigating and preventing asphaltene problems, an accurate prediction of asphaltene instability could help to minimize asphaltene remediation costs. While the Hildebrand solubility parameter concept has been previously used to determine the onset point of asphaltene precipitation in the stock tank oils, it does not capture the effect of dissolved gases on the onset solubility parameter. An empirical correlation between the onset solubility parameter and the molar volume of precipitants has been used to estimate the effect of dissolved gas on the onset solubility parameter of live oil. However, extrapolation of this correlation to higher temperatures and pressures is only valid over a very limited range. Consequently, a model was developed to predict the onset solubility parameter under live oil conditions based on the thermodynamic partial Gibbs free energy rule. Solubility parameters of the stock tank oil were determined and coupled with the equation of state models based on the PVT data of the live oils to predict the asphaltene instability of a live system. To validate the model, high temperature and high pressure experiments were performed using blends of live oil and miscible injection gases and the onset points of asphaltenes were determined. This model is capable of predicting asphaltene instability under live conditions over a wide range of temperatures and pressures. "]},

Solutions containing asphaltene mixtures from different crude oils result in significant variations in film thickness when compared with single asphaltene cases. For CN-Ceuta and DM153-Ceuta mixtures, a diminution was observed, whereas an increase was found with the DM153-Furrial mixture. Finally, the results attained with asphaltenes in which low molecular weight compounds have been removed suggest a film swelling effect due to the alkyl-type resins which are found to modify the colloidal properties of the aggregated asphaltenes in agreement with the literature.

Deposition in the near well bore regions and production tubulars implies high intervention and remediation costs. Prediction of asphaltene precipitation onset represents a challenge for the flow assurance area. The applicability of the PC-SAFT equation of state model to predict asphaltene onset of the precipitation in live oils is demonstrated by studying representative examples from field experiences with asphaltene problems during production. These examples not only validate the proposed model but also confirm the theory that asphaltene phase behavior can be explained based only on molecular size and van der Waals interactions. The PC-SAFT equation of state estimates also properties such as densities and bubble points of live oil systems using a minimum number of real components and “realistic” pseudocomponents. The amount and composition of the asphaltene precipitated phase is also determined as part of the equilibrium calculations. This paper presents experimental observations and simulation results at reservoir conditions using the PC-SAFT equation of state on the effect of compositional changes in live oils caused by two common processes in the oil industry:  oil-based-mud (OBM) contamination and reinjection of associated gas. In the first case, the downhole oil samples can be contaminated with OBM, causing laboratory measurements of the bubble point and asphaltene precipitation to be different from the reservoir fluid. In the second case, the reinjection of gas into the field increases the gas−oil-ratio (GOR) of the oil. The addition of gas into the oil can cause asphaltene precipitation and deposition due to the increase of light components that reduces asphaltene solubility. Asphaltenes in this example are treated as both monodisperse and polydisperse pseudocomponents. From the obtained results, it can be concluded that the live oil modeled using the PC-SAFT equation of state properly predicts the asphaltene phase behavior under these compositional changes. The PC-SAFT equation of state model is a commercially available, proven tool. "]},

Characterization of the foulant and the feed indicated that the fouling reactions are likely oxidative polymerization. Iron naphthenate or naphthenic acid in the HVGO stream could act as a catalyst for such a reaction. A bench-scale oxidation test was carried out to compare the oxygen uptake rates and the C", "-insoluble contents after oxidation in KCGO, KCGO plus HVGO, KCGO plus iron naphthenate, and KCGO plus naphthenic acid streams.

No significant increase of the C", "-insoluble content was observed for KCGO plus naphthenic acid, indicating that it was the iron naphthenate that catalyzed the fouling reactions.

Petroleum resids were found to contain high concentrations of natural hydrogen donors, and more are generated during thermolysis from substituted naphthenes in the resid. In contrast to the expected low concentration, the donor hydrogen concentration in the asphaltene fraction was found to be equivalent to the concentration in the full resid. However, the donor hydrogens in asphaltenes are more reactive than in any other fraction of the resid. This requires modifying the phase-separation mechanism for coke formation and the average chemical structure of asphaltenes. Thermal conversion of resid fractions in the presence of a super reactive hydrogen donor, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline, showed that the selectivity to distillable liquids can be increased but the formation of polyaromatic cores cannot be prevented. In addition, reactive hydrogen donors greatly reduce the thermal reaction rate by reducing the free-radical concentration. On the basis of these and previous results, methods to increase visbreaker conversion and to inhibit thermal cracking are described and the concept of an economic optimum conversion in resid hydroconversion is proposed.

A renewable fuel contributes to a lesser global climate change. Vegetable oil derivatives, namely, biodiesel, is being used in smaller volumes in some of the present day diesel engines. High smoke emission and lower thermal efficiency are the main problems associated with the use of neat vegetable oils in diesel engines. In the present paper we report on the utilization of rubber seed oil (RSO) as a primary fuel with eiethyl ether (DEE) as a combustion enhancer in a diesel engine. DEE was recently reported as a renewable fuel and a low-emission high-quality combustion improver. A single-cylinder, four-stroke, air-cooled direct injection diesel engine having a rated output of 4.4 kW was used for the experiments. DEE was injected into the intake port during the suction stroke, while RSO was injected directly inside the cylinder at the end of the compression stroke [23° BTDC (before top dead center)]. Parameters such as the injection timing, duration, and quantity of DEE were optimized at different loads. The brake thermal efficiency improves from 26.5% with neat RSO to a maximum of 28.5% with DEE injected at a rate of 200 g/h. The results also indicate a reduction in emissions except the NO", " level at all loads. Smoke is reduced significantly from 6.1 to 4 BSU (Bosch smoke units) with DEE injection. The combustion duration decreases with DEE injection, which will contribute to a higher heat release rate in the initial stages of combustion.

However, high solids processing poses mixing and heat-transfer problems above about 15% for pretreated corn stover solids.

An 8 L scraped surface bioreactor (SSBR) is employed here for enzymatic saccharification experiments to handle high solids loading and as a means for scale-up from laboratory-scale shake flasks. The scraping action of the blades keeps the reactor surface clear, which improves the heat-transfer characteristics. The horizontal rotation of the shaft and blades provides mixing and prevents particle settling much more effectively than in conventional stirred tanks, even at very low rotational speeds. The reactor is designed to be easily scaleable to pilot plant or production scale and operates at a specific power consumption of 0.56 kW/m", " or less, which is well below the typical power requirement range of industrial-scale reactors. The role of the viscosity of biomass slurries in power consumption of the reactor is presented. Insoluble solids are seen to be the dominant factor affecting viscosity when the remaining insoluble solids level is higher than about 12%, regardless of the initial solids concentration. Below this level, viscosity characteristics are attributed to multiple factors in addition to insoluble solids, such as solids composition, solids morphology, and liquid-phase composition. The efficiency of the saccharification reaction is defined as sugar released per unit energy input. Tests were performed for initial solids loadings between 10 and 25%, with results showing that the efficiency factor is the highest for 20% initial solids concentrations.

Predictions from a previously developed one-dimensional model, coupling mass- and heat-transfer effects, are compared to experimental polarization curves. The influence of the anode and cathode relative humidification level on the cell performance is explained under the light of the predicted water content across the membrane. Under the operating conditions studied, the net water flux of water is toward the anode. Accordingly, the influence of the anode humidification is not significant, and the influence of the cathode humidification has a high impact in fuel cell performance. Results show that fuel cell performance is better for experiments where higher water content values were obtained. In comparison to the anode feed flow rate influence, the influence of the cathode feed flow rate has a major impact in fuel cell performance."]},

Therefore, the onset of such events has to be reliably detected in an early stage and combined with counteractions to avoid further agglomeration and defluidization. The suitability of the attractor comparison method to detect agglomeration in combination with different counteraction strategies is investigated on a laboratory-scale (∼1 kW", ") and a small commercial-scale (∼1 MW", ") fluidized bed combustor. The agglomeration characteristics and the time until defluidization occurs can vary considerably depending on scale and process conditions, but also for similar operating conditions on the same scale. In all cases, attractor comparison has shown to detect the approach of defluidization early enough to prevent defluidization if a suitable counteraction strategy is applied. A temporary increase of fluidization velocity to promote agglomerate break-up is not a useful method to avoid agglomeration on laboratory-scale. A decrease in operating temperature below the melting points of potassium silicates can be a successful emergency strategy to ensure continued trouble-free operation. However, a subsequent temperature increase leads to further agglomeration, potentially very rapid, with alkali still present in the bed; therefore, some strategy to replace the bed content or neutralize the alkali is necessary. Semicontinuous replacement of bed material is shown to be a successful permanent solution to avoid defluidization. Yet, its application requires careful economic consideration. For larger reactor scales, agglomeration can occur more localized, which justifies several measuring positions.

A series of six unburned carbon samples from different combustors was collected and characterized by elemental analysis, petrographic composition, nitrogen adsorption isotherms, and thermogravimetric analysis. The elemental analyses show that all the unburned carbon samples consist mainly of carbon with very little hydrogen, nitrogen, sulfur, and oxygen. There appears to be a correlation between the C/H atomic ratio and the porous texture properties, where the lowest C/H ratio corresponds to the highest specific surface area and pore volume, and the smallest pore size. In addition, the potential use of unburned carbon as a precursor for activated carbon (AC) was investigated. Activated carbons with specific surface area up to 1270 m", "/g were produced from the unburned carbon. The porosity of the resultant activated carbons was related to the properties of the unburned carbon feedstock and the activation conditions used. It was found that not all the unburned carbon samples are equally suited for activation, and furthermore, their potential as AC precursors could be inferred from their physical and chemical properties. The developed porosity of the activated carbon was a function of the oxygen content, porosity, and H/C ratio of the parent unburned carbon feedstock. It was observed that extended activation times and high activation temperatures increased the porosity of the produced activated carbon at the expense of the solid yield. "]},

This increase is due to several factors like decreasing the dependence on imported petroleum; providing a market for the excess production of vegetable oils and animal fats; using renewable and biodegradable fuels; reducing global warming due to its closed carbon cycle by CO", " recycling; increasing lubricity; and reducing substantially the exhaust emissions of carbon monoxide, unburned hydrocarbons, and particulate emissions from diesel engines. However, there are major drawbacks in the use of biofuel blends as NOx tends to be higher, the intervals of motor parts replacement such as fuel filters are reduced and degradation by chronic exposure of varnish deposits in fuel tanks and fuel lines, paint, concrete, and paving occurs as some materials are incompatible. Here, fuel additives become indispensable tools not only to decrease these drawbacks but also to produce specified products that meet international and regional standards like EN 14214, ASTM D 6751, and DIN EN 14214, allowing the fuels trade to take place. Additives improve ignition and combustion efficiency, stabilize fuel mixtures, protect the motor from abrasion and wax deposition, and reduce pollutant emissions, among other features. Two basic trends are becoming more relevant:  the progressive reduction of sulfur content and the increased use of biofuels.

The changing trend of the oil main components versus the temperature could be concluded as follows:  with increasing temperature, the primary oil, containing mainly oxygenated compounds, was transformed into a secondary oil consisting of dominant phenolics; then, the oil became more aromatic with rising temperature and finally led to the tertiary oil that was dominated by PAHs. Meanwhile, the increasing temperature promoted secondary reactions of oil to result in the evolution of gases such as CO, CO", ", H", ", CH", ", and so forth.

The results show that the nonuniform distribution of stresses, caused by the temperature gradient in the cell, induces localized bending stresses, which can contribute to delaminating between the membrane and the gas diffusion layers. These stresses in the membrane may explain the occurrence of cracks and pinholes in the membrane under steady-state loading during regular cell operation. "]},

The oxidative process with ultrasound assistance has been improved for practical purposes by using solid adsorption instead of solvent extraction. Therefore, the advantages of both oxidative and adsorptive desulfurization have been put together for a modified continuous system to provide a source for portable fuel cells. Refractory sulfur compounds of benzothiophene and dibenzothiophene derivatives have been removed at 99% efficiency. The sulfur concentration in JP-8 jet fuel can be reduced from the original 850 ppm to 1 ppm at an oxidation time of 10 min at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure. Gas chromatograms from gas chromatography−sulfur chemiluminescence detection and gas chromatography−pulsed flame photometric detection evaluate the efficiency and selectivity of the ultrasound-assisted oxidative desulfurization (UAOD) process on different fuels after adsorption. gas chromatography−flame ionization detection, gas chromatography−mass spectrometry, and gas chromatography−simulated distillation were used to identify the concentration changes of sulfur compounds and hydrocarbons in fuels during the process. High sulfur adsorption capacities were obtained due to high conversion rates of the UAOD process. For marine gas oil, 12.8 mg of sulfur was removed per gram of alumina, which indicates the optimized process without the use of composite adsorbents. Acidic alumina shows promising results as an adsorbent in the UAOD process. Experiments prove that solid adsorbents are suitable for a scaleup to achieve ultralow sulfur fuel in the UAOD process.

The yields of THF solubles and oils increased with increasing irradiation power and time. The optimum irradiation power depends on the irradiation time to obtain the highest degradation products.

While the yields of THF solubles and oils sharply increased with irradiation power at longer reaction times, the yields of asphaltenes (AS) slightly decreased. Increasing oil yields is relatively larger when AS yields tend to decrease. These trends of AS and oil yields are ascribable to conversion of AS to oils at higher power.

According to the obtained results, the accuracy of the on-line measurements was not adequate and did not allow lignite quality monitoring in real time. The deterioration of the on-line measurements' accuracy, compared to previous applications in other mining sites, was related to the intense variation of the lignite ash content and ash composition, which distorted the calibration of the analyzer.

Further experimental work is needed to investigate solutions for successful implementation of this method to low-grade lignites that exhibit large variation in ash content and composition. "]},

The analysis of fractions with masses up to ∼400−450 u normally involves gas and liquid chromatography, coupled with mass spectrometry (GC−MS and LC−MS, respectively). However, these techniques cannot readily be adapted to examine samples that contain higher-molecular-mass materials. Chromatographic and mass spectrometric methods are often limited by the volatility of the samples, while liquid chromatographic methods may be limited by solubility in the solvents used. Materials of higher mass are characterized using methods that have been developed to overcome the limitations imposed by volatility and solubility in common solvents. As outlined in the text, they have been the subject of some debate. Much of the work that indicates upper mass limits of ∼1000−1500 u for coal tars, pitches, and petroleum asphaltenes can be explained in terms of limitations of the particular analytical techniques. The new emphasis on characterizing increasingly heavier materials grows out of a need in oil refineries and elsewhere, for fresh ideas about processing higher-mass feedstocks. Currently, above the ∼450−500 u range, no single method is unambiguously capable of indicating molecular mass distributions or chemical structural features in complex fuel-derived mixtures. Advances in this field require a comparison of evidence from several independent analytical methods.

Transferred films from the air/water interface on mica were studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Isotherms obtained from the Langmuir balance experiments for all samples are qualitatively similar and indicate that their interfacial behavior may be correlated to the molecular weight of the asphaltene samples. At mesoscopic scales, BAM images of asphaltene films deposited on the water surface reveal that asphaltene samples do not form a monomolecular film, as proposed in the literature, but rather a mixture of 2D and 3D domains. This behavior is confirmed when, on a hydrophilic surface such as mica, the film is transferred from the Langmuir trough and is found to be not homogeneous or monomolecular. AFM images revealed the formation of an irregular and meandering layer of 10.2−12.5 nm thickness. Initially, the films exhibit some mesostructures graphically identified as small and large disklike structures; these disks coalesce or fuse into more complex mesostructures:  drumsticklike and ribbonlike structures. A closer look revealed that these mesostructures are formed by small colloidal-like particles or small micelles (<100 nm). The spreading capacity of asphaltene on the mica surface seems to be related to the separation methods and the amount of resins associated with the asphaltenes. The complete coverage of the surface and the formation of an irregular 3D film occur as a function of aging time or when the transference pressure of the asphaltene film from water to mica is increased.

The mercury contents of the UBCs (Hg/UBC, in ppm) in raw ash samples were comparable to those of the UBC-enriched samples, indicating that mercury was mainly adsorbed on the UBC in fly ash.

In such systems, the exhaust gas of the anode is a multicomponent gas composed of hydrogen and carbon dioxide as main constituents and methanol, carbon monoxide, and steam as minor species. It is necessary to burn out these gases in order to prevent emissions of combustibles and to increase the overall efficiency of the fuel cell. A study on the characteristics of a catalytic monolith reactor to oxidize such a fuel gas in near-adiabatic conditions is performed. Emissions and reactor wall temperature distributions are measured during the combustion of several fuel gas mixtures corresponding to design and off-design fuel cell conditions, in a large range of excess air ratios. The high surface reactivity and diffusion properties of hydrogen are seen to greatly enhance the combustion of the other species, by bringing the wall at temperatures sometimes greater than the expected adiabatic. Ultralow emissions of carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbons are achieved even at a temperature as low as 250 °C, allowing for great flexibility of the use of air or high anode hydrogen utilization for the fuel cell. In addition, startup and transient operations with excessive methanol content are shown to be well handled by the reactor. Finally, a practical engineering rule is given by defining two mass flow variables:  one concerns the initial carbon containing fuel and the other the emitted unburned carbon containing fuel. These variables allow considering methanol and carbon monoxide as a single species, rendering the analysis independent of their respective concentrations in the multicomponent fuel mixture.

The cross-section of bed particles was examined for elements. The agglomeration temperature of the material from the particle seal was determined. The kaolin, in the form of a fine powder, was supplied to the particle seal. It was found to be carried by the flue gases to the electrostatic filter rather than staying in the bed. Despite this, alkali is removed from the furnace by the kaolin, and thereby, the agglomeration temperature of the bed material increases. The alkali ends up in the fly ash, in which the content of alkali increases and the solubility of alkali decreases, suggesting that alkali aluminum silicates have been formed.

According to thermodynamic predictions, almost 50% of the total ash is melted to form slag at 1300 °C in cofiring because of high calcium, iron, and potassium and hence mercury and other remaining metals are concentrated in small amounts of ash and show an increase at higher temperatures. No slag formation was predicted at 1000 °C. The results will help in predicting different forms of mercury emitted from the furnace with optimum secondary fuel composition and operating conditions.

In the absence of sulfur, lignin was completely gasified to methane, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen over the titania-supported ruthenium catalyst in supercritical water. In the presence of sulfur, the overall gas yield decreased and THF-insoluble products (namely, char) were formed. Also, the content of hydrogen increased in the resulting gas composition. To investigate the poisoning effect of sulfur for lignin gasification, the gasification behavior of 4-propylphenol and formaldehyde, which are low-molecular-weight model compounds from lignin decomposition, was studied in supercritical water. 4-Propylphenol was completely gasified in the absence of sulfur; however, it was hardly gasified in the presence of sulfur. On the other hand, the gasification of formaldehyde proceeded smoothly over the ruthenium catalyst regardless of the presence of sulfur. Also, the content of hydrogen in the gaseous products increased in the presence of sulfur.

Selective harvest of triticale straw components could reduce the content of Si and other minerals that impact the use of this biomass in thermochemical conversion processes."]},

At low surface temperatures (∼200 °C), the fouling propensity of CGO is very low, and at surface temperatures between ∼250 and 325 °C, the fouling propensity is slightly higher because of polymerization of unsaturated olefins. When the surface temperature is further increased to above 350 °C, fouling is observed to increase significantly because of familiar coking reactions. Slow polymerization of olefins and conjugated olefins was observed at temperatures of 270 and 300 °C. However, at 350 °C, thermal cracking reactions that produce olefins and conjugated olefins take place and significant amounts of fouling deposits can be formed at this temperature. The fouling deposits of CGO exhibit typical polyaromatic coke structures. A better understanding of how the various mechanisms interact with temperature will improve management of fouling in process streams containing olefins and conjugated olefins."]},

It is well understood that high heating rates, very small particles with low mass transfer limitations, and moderate operating temperatures are essential for obtaining high yield of liquid from the fast pyrolysis process. However, how the heating rates and operating temperatures would influence individual compounds in the liquid obtained from the fast pyrolysis process has not been studied in detail. Therefore, a microscale pyrolysis study was performed by changing different parameters (biomass type, filament heating rate, and final pyrolysis temperature) to understand the influence of these operating parameters on each compound formed during the process. Two biomass types (pine wood and switchgrass) were selected for this study: (i) pine wood was selected because of its availability in the southeastern region of the United States, and (ii) switchgrass was chosen because it has been identified as one of the bioenergy crops in the United States. Pyrolysis temperatures were changed from 450 to 750 °C in increments of 50 °C, whereas the heating rates selected were 50, 100, 500, 1000, and 2000 °C/s. Twenty-eight bio-oil compounds were quantified in each experimental condition. This study found that phenols and toluene concentrations increased with the increase in pyrolysis temperature irrespective to the biomass type. On the other hand, the change in the yield of ketones, furans, and guaiacols with the change in pyrolysis temperature depended on the type of biomass. The effect of filament heating rate on bio-oil yield was not statistically significant because the biomass heating rate was almost constant irrespective of different filament heating rates."]},

It has been discovered that, despite the permanent pressure gradient, the flow of the water-in-oil emulsion almost completely ceases with time. This effect is known as dynamic blocking. It becomes pronounced when the emulsions flow through a cylindrical microchannel, in the case of a plane flow in the elements of a fracture, and when the emulsion flows through a 3D capillary structure, such as a core. The sizes of the water microdrops in the emulsion are an order of magnitude smaller than the cross-section sizes of the microchannels. However, the structure that is formed of such microdrops blocks not only individual microchannels but also the entire microchannel system, including cores. The physical nature of the dynamic blocking of emulsions is connected to the deformations of the emulsion microdrops as the pressure gradient increases and to the friction among these microdrops. The friction between emulsion microdrops brings about non-equilibrium and nonlinear effects in the filtration flow. On the basis of these ideas, this work describes a mathematical model of two-phase filtration through a porous medium. The results of the mathematical model satisfactorily agree with the experimental data."]},

Knowledge of the wax appearance temperature (WAT) and the amount of wax that precipitates from the crude oil at different temperatures, i.e., the wax precipitation curve (WPC), is necessary for accurate predictions of wax deposition in subsea pipelines. The theoretical study of the wax precipitation process is frequently carried out using thermodynamic models. These models require as input information the molecular weight and the ", "-paraffin distribution of the crude oil. The ", "-paraffin distribution is commonly determined by high-temperature gas chromatography (HTGC) analysis, but it has some limitations such as the low signal/noise ratios, elution and resolution problems in the heavy compounds zone, and discrepancies with regard to the delineation of the baseline to integrate the chromatogram. In this work, three variables have been analyzed to improve the ", "-paraffin distribution obtained by HTGC: the total amount of C", " paraffin, extrapolation of paraffin concentration above C", ", and molecular weight of crude oil. The results predicted were compared to experimental data obtained by fractional precipitation and differential scanning calorimetry, showing great influence of the ", "-paraffin distribution on the model accuracy."]},

Optical microscopy was adopted to characterize the dispersion process, and the impacts of various factors on the process were studied by means of the particle size distribution (PSD) of catalysts, which was obtained from the micrographs using the Image-Pro Plus image analysis program. Effects of the dispersion on LHVR conversion and coke formation were then investigated in an autoclave simulating slurry-phase hydrocracking. The results indicated that the dispersion of catalyst is significantly improved by reducing the interfacial tension between the precursor solution and the feedstock, and the yield of lighter fraction (gas and gasoline), coke, content of asphaltene in bottom from products, and conversion of condensation reaction decrease to follow the decreasing interfacial tension. That is, higher dispersion of the catalyst could enhance the catalyst’s ability to inhibit in-depth condensation and excessive cracking. Higher stirring rate could promote the dispersion of catalyst and its ability in the low range, but there is a critical stirring rate. Lowering concentration of the precursor solution is slightly conducive to improving the dispersion of catalyst and its ability, but the degree of enhancement is more minor compared with the interfacial tension."]}
